# The BiblioNest 📚🪺

_A cozy digital sanctuary for readers to discover, save, and reflect on the books they love._

## ✨ About

The BiblioNest is a book-focused web application that allows readers to search for books, view detailed information, log into their account and curate their own digital library. Whether you're a casual reader or a passionate collector, The BiblioNest provides a warm, personal space to organize your reading life — without being beholden to Big Tech.

Built with ❤️ by **Ann Mathenge**, and regularly supervised by her fluffy coworker, **Cate** the British Longhair.
